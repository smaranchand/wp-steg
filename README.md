# wp-steg
WP-STEG is a WordPress security tool that exploits directory listing and a core WordPress behavior: when media are uploaded but not attached to published posts (for example, if the post is left in draft), it uses the WP-JSON API alongside raw directory access to compare and identify orphaned files.
